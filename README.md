Where is Pymaco come from?
-- Python for Mathematics and Computation.

I believe with the computer technologies evolve, people will get lots of history data,
maybe terabytes, perabytes scale. You can't find any value without beautiful and easy
to use tools. Python have developed to the state of full-fledged community and there 
are lots of open source packages for data analysis and Machine learning.

$cd pymaco
$source bin/activate
